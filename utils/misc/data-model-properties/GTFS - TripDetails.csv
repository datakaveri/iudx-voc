arrival_time,TXP,"Specifies the arrival time at a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. Times must be eight digits in HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted, if the hour begins with 0). 
Note: Trips that span multiple dates will have stop times greater than 24:00:00. For example, if a trip begins at 10:30:00 p.m. and ends at 2:15:00 a.m. on the following day, the stop times would be 22:30:00 and 26:15:00. Entering those stop times as 22:30:00 and 02:15:00 would not produce the desired results.

stop_sequence,QP,"This field identifies the order of the stops for a particular trip. The values for stop_sequence must be non-negative integers, and they must increase along the trip.
For example, the first stop on the trip could have a stop_sequence of 1, the second stop on the trip could have a stop_sequence of 23, the third stop could have a stop_sequence of 40, and so on.

This field specifies how much of the shape to draw between any two stops during a trip. Must be in the same units used in shapes.txt Values used for shape_dist_traveled must increase along with stop_sequence; they cannot be used to show reverse travel along a route.
