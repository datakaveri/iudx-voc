# IUDX Vocabulary

## Introduction

IUDX Vocabulary is a collection of [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) serialized 
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) schemas widely used by IUDX Subsystems and 
datasources made available through IUDX Platforms.

We build over ideas and concepts standardized by [schmea.org](schema.org) and 
build custom ontologies and semantic constructs to standardize IUDX operations, data access,
and interoperable data comprehension.

We standardize our schemas with popular strcutured data schema providers 
such as [schmea.org](schema.org), [smart data models](https://smartdatamodels.org/),
[iotschema.org](http://iotschema.org/) and [dkat](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#dcat-scope)
wherever possible in an effort to link ontologies and provide for interoperability.

Schemas hosted here are available in web-view format on [IUDX Vocabulary Server](https://voc.iudx.org.in)


## Structure
We bifurcate our schemas into the following three categories
- data-types: Basic json data types, such as Number, Boolean, Text, etc
- base-schemas: Core concepts generally used in iudx internal operations and general concepts which serve as building blocks to advance concepts
- datamodels: Data comprehension vocabulary for diverse domains of datasources building upon concepts defined in base-schemas
